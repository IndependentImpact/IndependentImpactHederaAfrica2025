## Anti-gaming mechanisms

### Single account per user

A user can only have one account on the platform and must pass an identity check upon account creation. This is to prevent users from reviewing their own activities under a different identity.

### Restrictions on simultaneous logins

A user cannot be logged into the platform from more than two different devices at the same time, nor can they be logged in from more than one device of the same kind at once. For example, a user can be logged in from their laptop and their phone at the same time, but they cannot be logged in from two different laptops at once. 

### Period-based action limits

Many actions on the platform are subject to rate limits. Please refer to Appendix UYU for the rate limits applicable to each action.

### Reputation limits

(Minima and maxima. TODO.)
