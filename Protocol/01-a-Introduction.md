## Introduction

Independent Impact is a platform for transparently reporting  and quantifying all conceivable anthropogenic impact on natural and social environments. The platform is intended to be a non-prescriptive, decentralised, Web3 alternative to the traditional, institutionalised registries and standards bodies that have been overseeing similar activities (especially carbon offset activities in the voluntary carbon market) over the past few decades. It also intends to usher in a new class of standards, activities and tokenised assets for which there is currently no non-web3  alternative. 

This document details the Independent Impact Protocol that governs the platform. The first section of this document gives an overview of the concepts and terminology used on the platform. The second section of the document lays out the principles that underpin the protocol. The Agent Reputation System is described in the third section, the Impact Scoring System is detailed in the fourth section. More information on the other scoring systems in operation on the platform is provided in the fifth section. The sixth, seventh and eighth sections deal with bounties, voting and commenting respectively. The anti-gaming mechanisms employed on the platform are detailed in the ninth section. The final section describes the technical implementation  of the protocol on the platform .
