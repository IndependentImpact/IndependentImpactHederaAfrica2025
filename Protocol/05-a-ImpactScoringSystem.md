## Impact Scoring System

### Overview

The Impact Scoring System (ImSco for short) is designed to measure how sure we can be about the extent and cause of some claimed impact. To do so, the system currently measures an impact and the activity that purportedly effected it against Independent Impact’s sets of impact, accounting and reporting principles declared earlier; future upgrades to the platform will, however, accommodate other standards as well.

An ImSco score has two components to it: a validation component and a verification component. Both components are determined through a review process. In a typical scenario, the owner of an activity will publish several review requests for their activity as it progresses through the phases of planning, implementation and eventually monitoring. The initial review requests will typically be validation requests, while the later review requests (i.e., during or after implementation) will be verification requests. 

Validation reviews evaluate the design of an activity before implementation (i.e., ex ante). They assess the likelihood that an activity will, if implemented according to its design, achieve its intended impact(s) while complying with some specific standard (chosen by the owner of the activity). The Independent Impact platform does not by default require an activity to undergo any validation reviews, but owners of activities – especially potentially high-risk and high-impact activities – are strongly encouraged to perform validation reviews before they proceed to implementation. Not only do validation reviews help activity owners to identify blind spots; they could also help them to secure funding for the implementation of their activities. 

Verification reviews evaluate an activity and its impacts during and or after implementation and impact monitoring (i.e., ex post). They assess  what actually occurred during the implementation of the activity and the monitoring of its impacts. As with validation reviews, the Independent Impact platform does not by default require that an activity or an impact claim undergoes verification; however, if no verification reviews are performed, no verification scores will be available for the activity or its impact claims, and the activity will almost certainly not find any buyers for its claimed impacts.

Validation and verification reviews are conducted according to the rules laid out in the ‘Reputation-based reviewing’ section. There is no difference between validation and verification reviews in terms of process; they do, however, make use of different reviewer question sets. The questions that will be in each set are determined by the chosen standard.

After a review had been conducted, the system will assign at most one  ImSco (validation/verification) point for each question to which the review panel had provided a positive response. If some aspect of an impact had already been reviewed during a previous review, the score for that aspect of the impact will be updated to the score from the current (i.e., most recent) review. To gain the maximum ImSco score possible (according to the chosen standard), all aspects of an impact (at least all aspects that are of interest to the chosen standard) must receive a positive review. This means that all aspects must be reviewed at least once and, if some aspects do not obtain perfect scores on their first review, the issues identified during their reviews must be addressed and new review requests must subsequently be published for those particular aspects. This process must be repeated until all issues have been resolved and each of the aspects has consequently received a positive review.

The other factor that impacts an ImSco score is the Knowledge & Skills reputation of the reviewers. To gain the maximum ImSco score possible per review, the reputation of the reviewers must meet or exceed the chosen standard’s ‘Expert’ threshold  for the relevant KS domains. If the reviewers’ reputation amounts are lower than the Expert threshold, the score from the review will be weighted against their reputation. 

The following example illustrates how ImSco is calculated from a review:

The owner of Activity ABC publishes a request on the platform to review aspects T and V of their activity against Standard P. They specify that the mandate of the review is validation, and that a user must have at least 15 reputation points in the Marine Conservation Knowledge & Skills domain to submit a review. 

User Y, who has a Marine Conservation KS reputation score of 16, sees the review request and decides to respond. Standard P provides a set of nine validation review questions that must be used to review aspects T and V of an activity. User Y uses those nine questions to evaluate Activity ABC and subsequently submits a review that contains a positive response to seven of the nine review questions, but a negative response to the other two questions (because they found errors in the information or something similar).

Based on User Y’s review, Activity ABC can at most be awarded seven out of nine validation ImSco points for aspects T and V. However, Standard P specifies that a user is only considered an expert in their domain if they have at least 18 KS reputation points in that domain. User Y currently has only 16 Marine Conservation KS reputation points, so the outcome of their review will be adjusted by a factor of 16/18. The final ImSco score assigned to Activity ABC for the validation of aspects T and V, based on the review of User Y, is thus (7/9) * (16/18) * 100 = 69.1%.

The owner of Activity ABC can now choose to do one of three things:  

(a)	Address the issues identified by User Y and then submit a new review request.  

(b)	Appeal User Y’s review (see Section YUY of this document for details on the dispute process).  

(c)	Nothing. This means that Activity ABC’s validation score for aspects T and V will forever remain at 69.1%. This score will be publicly available to everyone, including potential impact buyers.  

A few final notes are in order to conclude the overview:  

(a)	There is no limit  on the number of validation or verification reviews that can be performed on an activity or an impact. There are also no restrictions on or prescriptions for the extent of the scope of a review request. The owner of an activity can therefore either publish several narrowly scoped (validation or verification) review requests, or publish single, broadly scoped (validation or verification) review request.  

(b)	The owner of an activity can choose whether they want to allow other agents to provide information about their activity and its impacts. This may help them to gather the desired information quicker, or may provide them with a richer corpus of information. Information contributed by someone other than the activity owner will not, however, automatically be granted ImSco points – any information must be reviewed by someone other than the owner and contributor (if those were separate agents) of the information if ImSco points are to be gained from it.

### Reviewable aspects of impacts

The Independent Impact platform acknowledges a set list of impact and activity aspects by default. Activity owners are encouraged to provide information for their activities and impacts for as many of these aspects as possible. The platform provides an extensive list of guiding questions to aid activity owners in doing so. 

Each of the aforementioned aspects is reviewable. For the default impact and activity aspects, reviewers are equipped with a rigorous set of questions to assist them in evaluating those aspects according to the Independent Impact principles. 

The full list of default impact and activity aspects and their definitions, along with their guiding questions and their reviewer questions per mandate (validation/verification), are given in Appendix TTT.  A positive reviewer response to a review question will grant the impact or activity either (maximum) one validation point or (maximum) one verification point. The current maximum validation score possible is 83 points, while the current maximum verification score is 70 points. 

Note that other standards, when the platform is ready to accommodate them, may identify additional activity aspects which owners will need to provide information for (and have reviewed) if they wish to comply with those standards.
