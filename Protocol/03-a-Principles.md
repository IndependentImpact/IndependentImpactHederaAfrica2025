
## Principles

The Independent Impact Protocol is informed by four sets of principles – general principles, impact principles, accounting principles and reporting principles. Each set of principles is discussed below.

### General principles

1. **Openness.** Everyone should be able to / be empowered to contribute to common goals for good. Engaging in climate action or biodiversity conservation should not be something reserved for large companies with large “ESG” budgets and/or compliance regulations to meet. Smaller companies, organisations and individual citizens, with good intention, knowledge and skills, should be empowered  to contribute in their respective capacities to humankind’s work towards a better world for all.  

2. **Guidance, not prescription.** Incentivise and penalise transparently, but do not inhibit communally beneficial action through fixed, overly burdensome prescriptions or disproportionate administrative burdens.  

3. **Meritocracy.** Open collaboration should be governed through meritocracy. Give credit where credit is due.  

The platform is designed to give effect to these principles. For example, anyone can engage with the platform, but a comprehensive reputation system ensures that more opportunities are available to agents who maintain good conduct and who improve their knowledge and skills. Furthermore, an agent can start to report on their activities at any point in time – they do not need to complete a process of validation and registration of their activities first; an extensive scoring system, however, ensures that activities conducted according to high standards are clearly distinguishable from activities that do not uphold similar standards. 

### Impact principles

Agents should ideally see to it that their activities adhere to the following principles,  to ensure that they maximise beneficial impact and minimise harm:  

1. **Purposefulness.** An activity should have a clearly defined, justified purpose aimed at producing a net-positive  outcome for society or the environment.  

2. **Integrity of intent.** The motivation behind an activity should be genuine, transparent, and aligned with stated sustainability or ethical goals.  

3. **Do no harm.** An activity should avoid, mitigate, or compensate for any foreseeable negative impacts that it may have, particularly on vulnerable populations or ecosystems. In the face of scientific uncertainty and potential for serious harm, the burden of proof should fall on demonstrating safety before action.  

4. **Effectiveness.** The chosen intervention  should be demonstrably capable of achieving its intended outcomes under realistic conditions.  

5. **Efficiency.** The desired impact should be achieved with the least necessary resource use and collateral burden.  

6. **Equity & inclusivity.** The benefits and burdens of an activity should be distributed fairly, with particular consideration given to marginalised stakeholders.  

7. **Adaptiveness.** Activities should, where relevant, be periodically reviewed and adjusted in response to observed outcomes and contextual changes.  

The platform encourages adherence to these principles by providing a rich set of questions that agents can use to guide them when they plan their activities. Reviewers are equipped with an equally rich set of questions to evaluate whether an activity adhered to these principles. The review process will reward activities who adhere to these principles with high scores.  For the full lists of activity owner questions and reviewer questions, refer to Appendix XXX.

Scoring systems are also in place for the effectiveness and efficiency of intervention instruments. Intervention instruments can furthermore have scores for durability, ease of use, etc. These scoring systems are to help activity owners determine which intervention instruments are more appropriate or less appropriate for their activities and their contexts. They also help reviewers to evaluate the intervention measures of activities.

### Accounting principles

When accounting for the impact of their activities, agents should ideally adhere to the following principles  to ensure that the impacts of their activities are determined accurately, consistently, and transparently:  

1. **Relevance.** Accounting should focus on the impacts that are significant to decision-making and stakeholders.  

2. **Completeness.** All material impacts within the defined boundary should be included, avoiding selective reporting.  

3. **Consistency.** Methods and assumptions should be applied consistently over time and across comparable activities.  

4. **Accuracy.** Estimates should be as precise as possible given available data and methods, minimizing bias and uncertainty.  

5. **Conservativeness.** Where uncertainty remains, assumptions should err on the side of not overstating benefits or understating harms.  

6. **Transparency.** All data sources, assumptions, and methods should be clearly documented and open to verification.  

7. **Traceability.** Each impact value should be traceable back to verifiable data, methods, and responsible entities.  

8. **Verifiability.** Independent parties should be able to reproduce or confirm the reported results based on available information.  

The platform provides a rich set of questions to agents (see Appendix XXX) to guide them towards adherence to these principles when accounting for the impacts of their activities. Reviewers are similarly equipped with a set of questions (see Appendix YYY) to help them evaluate whether an activity’s impact accounting adhered to these principles.

Furthermore, the platform is intentionally designed to maximise transparency, traceability and verifiability. Every action performed on the platform is transparently recorded on the Hedera network. All information provided about activities, and any changes made thereto, along with the authors of the information and the changes, are captured in a publicly accessible, time-travelable  Fluree ledger.

### Reporting principles

When providing information about activities and their impacts agents should ideally adhere to the following principles  to ensure that such information is of high quality, credible, and usable:  

1. **Clarity.** Information should be presented in a clear, comprehensible manner for its intended audience.  

2. **Relevance.** Reports should focus on information that is useful for stakeholders’ decisions and evaluations.  

3. **Completeness.** Positive and negative results alike should be disclosed, avoiding cherry-picking or greenwashing.  

4. **Faithful representation.** Information should be free from material error or distortion.  

The platform provides a set of questions to reviewers (see Appendix TTT) to help them evaluate the quality of information according to the principles above. In addition, the platform is designed to maximise the accessibility, accountability and comparability of information by capturing all information in a public, semantic ledger with a complete history of authorship.  

5. **Accessibility.** Information should be easy to find, access, and use, including for non-specialist audiences.  

6. **Accountability.** Those responsible for producing and reporting information should be clearly identified and answerable for its quality.  

7. **Comparability.** Information should be presented in a way that allows comparisons across time, activities, and entities.
