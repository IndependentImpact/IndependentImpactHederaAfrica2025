## Voting

### Reputation-based voting

When an indicator, instrument, method or methodology is published on the platform, it automatically sends out a vote request across the platform, inviting agents to vote on its reliability, durability, etc. (whichever is relevant). Such voting is based on reputation and is governed by the following rules:

1.	Reputation-based voting is always domain-specific.  

2.	Every vote must be accompanied by a comment from the agent explaining why they voted as they voted.  

3.	Any agent, regardless of their relevant reputation score, can cast a vote; however, only the votes of agents with sufficient reputation will directly affect the outcome of the voting (e.g., the indicator’s reliability score). An ineligible vote, along with its accompanying voter’s comment, will still be visible to all other agents and could therefore potentially influence subsequent votes by other, eligible agents – for example, if it raises a valid concern that may have been overlooked by previous voters.  

4.	A voting request will always specify the minimum amount of reputation points (in a specific reputation domain) that an agent requires to cast an eligible vote. This minimum requirement, however, only applies to the first two eligible votes; thereafter the minimum amount of reputation required to vote is calculated as the rolling average of the reputation scores of the preceding eligible voters. Where more than five eligible votes have been cast, the calculation will consider only the five most recent eligible votes.  

5.	The outcome of a vote is calculated as the rolling reputation-weighted average of the eligible votes. Where more than five eligible votes have been cast, the calculation will consider only the five most recent eligible votes.  

6.	There is in principle no end to the voting period – any agent can at any point in time cast a vote on some indicator’s reliability, if, for example, new information or new research findings have come to light and the agent feels that the current reliability score for the indicator is no longer justified. They can cast their vote without having to create a new voting request, but, should they wish to reattract the attention of other experts and ask them to (re-)vote on the indicator’s reliability in the light of the new information or findings, they can send out a new voting request. To send out a new voting request, an agent must have sufficient reputation points in the relevant domain. TODO: How many?  

7.	Any agent who casts a vote, whether eligible or not, will receive one CR point for doing so.
