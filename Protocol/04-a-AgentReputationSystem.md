## Agent Reputation System

The actions and behaviour of agents on the platform are governed by an elaborate reputation system. There are two primary domains in which an agent can have reputation, namely Knowledge & Skills and Conduct. All reputation is primarily gained and lost through actions and consequent events.  

### Knowledge & Skills reputation

The Knowledge & Skills reputation (KSR) domain is divided into subdomains representing different areas of expertise, such as “Marine Conservation”, “Air Quality Offsets”, “Carbon Offsets” and “Early Childhood Development” (the full list of subdomains are given in Appendix XXX). 

KSR can be gained  in several ways, such as through the verification of education or experience credentials, through receiving upvotes on a response posted to a help forum question, or through the contribution of a methodology. KSR can similarly be lost in several ways, such as by providing inaccurate information  , receiving downvotes on a response to a help forum question, or losing a formal dispute. KSR can also be lost through time-based decay (more details are provided in the ‘Time-based decay’ section below). KSR cannot drop below zero.

Agents primarily use their KSR to earn income. For example, a review request will typically specify a minimum amount of reputation that an agent must have in a particular KSR domain to respond as a paid reviewer to the request. 

### Conduct reputation

An agent’s Conduct reputation (CR) score represents how active, helpful and respectful they have been on the platform to date. Unlike KS reputation, the Conduct reputation (CR) domain is not divided into subdomains, but is designed to incentivise thoroughness, reliability and respectful behaviour, while penalising bias, misinformation and disrespectful behaviour.

CR is gained through collaboration, positive contributions and good conduct. For example, casting a vote on the reliability of a newly proposed methodology will let an agent gain one CR point. When an activity owner requests a review of some aspect of their activity, they will also gain one CR point. If an agent asks a question on the help forum and at least three other agents “upvote” it as an important question (or one that they have too), the asking agent will be granted a CR point. 

CR is primarily lost through undesirable behaviour. If, for example, an agent posts a response to a question on the help forum, and at least three other agents   “downvote ” it as a rude, irrelevant or deliberately misleading response, they will lose a CR point. If an agent claimed a seat on a review panel, but later cancels their seat, they can lose several CR points. Similarly, if an agent publishes a review request and then cancels it later, they will lose CR points. As with KSR, CR can also be lost through time-based decay.

An agent’s CR balance can drop below zero if they engage in more undesirable behaviour than desirable behaviour. If an agent’s CR balance drops below zero, their account will automatically be suspended from performing certain actions until their CR balance has sufficiently recovered (either by decaying to zero, or through the agent performing some “good” actions again – among the actions that they are still allowed to perform). If an agent’s CR  balance drops below a critical, negative threshold, the agent’s account will be suspended completely  from any and all activity until their CR balance has recovered sufficiently through time-based decay.

CR functions similar to shares in that agents with positive CR will be eligible for “dividends” paid out quarterly on a portion of the platform’s profit. 

For the full list of actions and the amount of CR gained or lost through each please refer to Appendix Y – Agent actions and events.

For the list of CR thresholds and the actions that they suspend or open up, see ???.

Possible alternative names for CR: TRIB, WINK, NOD, PAT, PEAS, (coffee/green) BEANS, COCO (coconuts), grapes, oranges, miles, claps, caps, DUC(K)(S)/DUX.

### Time-based decay

All reputation – KSR and CR – decays. KSR decays  at a rate of X points every Y months, while CR (both positive and negative CR) decays at a rate of D points every M months. Decay stops the moment that a reputation balance reaches zero, i.e., it cannot drop below zero due to decay. 

Decay incentivises agents to remain active on the platform and to keep their knowledge and skills up to date. Elaborate.
