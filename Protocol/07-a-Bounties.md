## Bounties

### General

A bounty on the II platform is very similar to its real-world counterpart: it is a sum of money locked up in a smart contract along with a description of a task that must be executed by an agent who wishes to receive the money. Any agent can publish a bounty for some task, if they have the necessary funds to do so. Bounties can be published for many things, such as gathering data, reviewing information, or creating an indicator. Bounties are typically open, which means that any agent who meets the requirements stated by the creator of the bounty can participate in its pursuit.

Where bounties on the II platform do differ from their traditional counterparts is the limitation that they place on the number of agents who can pursue the bounty at once. A bounty for a small task will typically allow only one agent to pursue it at any given point in time; a bounty for a larger task may allow multiple agents at once, but the agents will typically be required to collaborate, instead of compete. The purpose of this limitation is two-fold:

(a)	Incentivise thoroughness over speed. Elaborate.
(b)	Prevent wastage of human resources. Elaborate.

**Note** The agents who pursue a bounty are referred to as the “mission team” of the bounty.

Below follows the full set of rules that govern the creation of and participation in bounties on the Independent Impact platform:

1.	Any agent can create a bounty for any of the tasks listed in Appendix SWS.  

2.	The sum of money (typically in the form of HBAR) pledged as compensation for successful completion of the task will be deducted from the account of the creator of the bounty at the time of creation and will be placed in a smart contract escrow.  

3.	The bounty period is divided into three subperiods or phases:  
a.	the team assembly phase;
b.	the mission phase; and
c.	the dispute resolution phase. 

The dates that mark the start and end of each of the phases must be clearly specified by the creator of the bounty upon publication of the bounty. The dispute resolution phase must be at least seven days in length, but not longer than 30 days.

4.	The creator of a bounty may, but is not required to, specify some minimum KS or CR reputation requirements that an agent must fulfil to be eligible to pursue the bounty.  

5.	Where minimum reputation requirements are specified for multiple KS domains, the creator of the bounty must also clearly specify how the compensation will be divided among the KS domains. Explain this through an example.  

6.	The number of places (also referred to as “seats” or “spots”) available on a bounty’s mission team will be determined by the number of KS reputation domains for which the creator of the bounty specified a minimum score requirement: 
a.	If no such requirements were specified, the mission team can consist of only one agent. 
b.	If reputation requirements were specified, the mission team can at most consist of one agent per KS domain. 

7.	An agent who wishes to participate in the pursuit of a bounty signals their intent by claiming  a place on the mission team. As soon as a place is claimed, the place is no longer available to other agents.  

8.	If reputation criteria were specified for a specific seat, an agent can only claim that seat if they meet those requirements.  

9.	An agent can claim multiple seats on a mission team, provided that they meet the minimum reputation criterion for each of the seats claimed.  

10.	An agent cannot occupy seats on more than three mission teams on the platform at any point in time.  
  
11.	An agent can cancel their claim on a mission team seat, but will lose  CR by doing so: 
a.	If an agent cancels their seat claim during the team assembly phase or within the first quarter of the mission phase, they will lose one CR point.
b.	If an agent cancels their seat claim in the second quarter  of the mission phase, they will lose two CR points.
c.	Cancelling a seat during the third quarter of the mission phase, will cost an agent three CR points.
d.	A seat cancellation during the fourth quarter of the mission phase will cost and agent four CR points. 
A seat cannot be cancelled during the dispute resolution phase.

12.	An agent can transfer their mission team seat claim to another agent if it becomes apparent to them that they will not, due to circumstances beyond their control, be able to fulfil their responsibilities  on time (i.e., before the end of the mission phase). If the transfer occurs before the end of the second quarter of the mission phase, the original holder of the seat will not lose any CR; if the transfer occurs after the end of the second quarter of the mission phase, the original holder of the seat will lose one CR point.

A seat transfer cannot occur during the dispute resolution phase.  

13.	An agent can only transfer their mission team seat to an agent who: 
a.	meets the domain-specific reputation criteria for the seat, if such were specified;
b.	does not hold seats on more than two other mission teams at the time of the transfer; and
c.	formally agrees to the transfer.  

14.	An agent who has transferred their seat on a mission team to another agent will not receive any compensation at the end of the bounty period, regardless of when or why the transfer occurred; the new agent (i.e., the agent to whom the seat has been transferred) will be singularly and entirely eligible for the compensation reserved for the seat.  

15.	A bounty can be cancelled by its creator, but the creator will lose CR, and potentially some of their escrowed funds, by doing so. 
a.	If cancelled during the team assembly phase or during first quarter of the mission phase, the creator will lose one CR point; if cancelled during the second quarter, they will lose two CR points; if cancelled during the third quarter, the creator will lose three CR points; if cancelled during the final quarter, the creator will lose four CR points. 
b.	An agent who had held a seat on the mission team for at least one quarter of the mission phase by the time the bounty was cancelled by the creator will receive 25 % of the compensation that was escrowed for them; an agent who had held a seat on the mission team for at least two quarters of the mission phase by the time the bounty was cancelled by the creator will receive 50 % of the compensation that was escrowed for them; an agent who had held a seat on the mission team for at least three quarters of the mission phase by the time the bounty was cancelled by the creator will receive 75 % of the compensation that was escrowed for them. Any funds left in escrow after the mission team has been duly compensated will be returned to the account of the bounty creator.  

A bounty cannot be cancelled during the dispute resolution phase.  

16.	Each agent who holds a seat on a bounty’s mission team must submit their work before the mission deadline specified by the creator of the bounty.  

17.	If an agent with a seat on a mission team fails to submit their work on time, the failure will be treated as a seat cancellation; the agent will therefore lose CR according to the seat cancellation rules specified above, and will not receive any part of the bounty.  

18.	A bounty is by default open to all agents on the platform, meaning that the spots on the mission team will be given to the first eligible agents who claim them. The creator of a bounty can, however, choose to follow an invitation-only approach, meaning that seats on the mission team will only be available to agents who were specifically invited by the creator of the bounty.  

19.	If a bounty reaches the end of its team assembly period and none of the seats on the mission team has been filled, the bounty will automatically be cancelled by the platform. The creator of the bounty will not lose any CR, and the full bounty will be returned to the account of the creator.  

20.	If a bounty reaches the end of its team assembly period and only some of the seats, but not all, have been filled, the creator of the bounty will have the following options:
a.	Republish the bounty with new dates for the different phases, and possibly also with some adjustments to the reputation requirements and the size of the bounty.
b.	Continue with the bounty, allowing the existing mission team to move into the mission phase of the bounty period. Bounty portions for unfilled seats will be returned  to the creator of the bounty at the end of the bounty period.
c.	Cancel the bounty. In this case, neither the creator of the bounty nor any of the mission team members will lose any CR, and the full bounty will be returned to the account of the creator.  

21.	Describe what happens during the dispute resolution phase. The creator of the bounty can request minor changes or corrections to work submitted by the mission team, and the mission team will be obliged to respond to those requests before the end of the dispute resolution phase. If the creator of the bounty has serious concerns about or objections to the work of the mission team, they can open a formal dispute that will be adjudicated by … The dispute resolution phase is also the period during which team members can lodge complaints with the bounty creator about each other (e.g., if the team feels that member X did not contribute their fair share, then they can lodge a complaint against member X with the bounty creator who will then…).  

22.	The bounty will be paid out to the mission team at the end of the dispute resolution phase of the bounty period.  

23.	The creator of a bounty will earn CR proportionate to the size of the bounty. Give the formula.  

**Note** Every bounty will have its own discussion topic to facilitate communication between the creator of the bounty and the mission team, and also between the members of the mission team as they collaborate on the task at hand. Only the creator of the bounty and the mission team will be able to post to the discussion topic, but the topic will be made publicly visible once  the bounty period has ended.

### Reputation-based reviewing

An agent can publish a request for the review of some claim or information. A review request is a type of bounty and is therefore governed by the rules provided in Section Bounty. However, several additional rules apply to review requests, as follows:

**Note** The mission team of a review request is referred to here as the “review panel”.

**Note** When a bounty is a review request, its dispute resolution phase doubles up as the “Q&A phase” of the review request.

1.	If an agent who wishes to publish a review request is neither the owner   nor the contributor of the information that will be the subject of the review, they must obtain permission from the owner of the information to create the review request.    

2.	A review request must clearly specify the subject   of the review, e.g., “Review of statistical robustness of activity XYZ’s planned sampling strategy for impact monitoring,” or “Validation of the purpose of project ZBA.”   

3.	A review request must clearly state the mandate of the review, i.e., whether the objective is to validate, to verify or both.  

4.	A review request must specify the standard  against which the review should be carried out.  

5.	The creator of the review request must specify at least one minimum KS reputation requirement for at least one relevant KS domain that must be met by agents who wish to act as reviewers.  

6.	Every reviewer must sign a declaration of conflicts of interest.  

7.	An agent cannot review information contributed by or related to them or their activities.  

8.	Each reviewer who holds a seat on a review request’s panel must submit a review before the review deadline specified by the creator of the review request. Where multiple reviewers are present on a panel, the reviewers are encouraged to communicate with each other during the review period, in the interest of complementing each other’s experience, knowledge and skills. Each reviewer will, however, still have to submit their own review to the review request before the review deadline.  

9.	Due compensation will be paid for an eligible review regardless of the outcome of the review.  

10.	Every review request provides the opportunity to one “ineligible” agent (i.e., an agent with not enough relevant reputation points yet to submit an eligible review) to submit a “training” review. The trainee’s review must, during the Q&A phase at the end of the review period, be reviewed and graded by every eligible reviewer on the review panel. The grade assigned by an eligible reviewer will determine the amount of reputation points (up to a maximum of one) that the trainee reviewer will gain in the reputation domain of each eligible reviewer who had held a seat on the panel of the review request in question.  

11.	An “expert” reviewer who fails to grade the trainee reviewer’s review at the end of a review process will lose two CR points.  

12.	During the Q&A period the reviewer must respond to any final questions that the review requester may have regarding the review that they had submitted. A reviewer who fails to respond to such questions will lose one CR point.  

13.	How can a review outcome be contested? During the dispute resolution phase (which all bounties, and therefore all RRs, have by default). What are the rules? Can a review be retracted by a reviewer?  

**Note** It is advisable to restrict the scope of a review request as much as possible. A review with a broad scope will necessarily span several knowledge domains (i.e., reputation domains), which may lead to a large number of reviewers having to collaborate on the review. The more reviewers per request, the more complicated the coordination among them.  

**Note** The trainee seat of the review system is a feature that cannot be “turned off” or prevented by the creator of the review request. It is an essential component of the Independent Impact platform and is tied to our strong belief that knowledge and skills should be shared with those who are willing to learn.
