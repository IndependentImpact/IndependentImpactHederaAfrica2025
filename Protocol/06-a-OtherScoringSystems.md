
## Other scoring systems

### Indicators

Indicators can have reliability scores. These scores influence the overall score of the impact claims based on them.

A reliability  score is assigned to an indicator through a voting process.

### Methods

Methods and methodologies can have scores for robustness (scientific rigour). They can also have scores for applicability relative to specific impact indicators and contexts. These scores influence the overall score of the impact claims based on them.

### Instruments

Measurement instruments can have scores for precision, accuracy and consistency . In the case of a physical piece of equipment, these scores can be easily and automatically derived from the product sheet ; in the case of other instruments, however, such as questionnaires, it may be more difficult and may require voting. 

Impact instruments can have scores for efficiency, efficacy, durability, ease of use, etc.

These scores influence the overall score of the impact claims based on them.

### Educational and training courses

Educational credentials (and the courses by which they are obtained) can have quality (depth and completeness) scores. These scores will determine how many reputation points an agent can gain by obtaining the respective credentials.

### Miscellaneous

Users of the platform will likely encounter other scoring systems also in operation on the platform. Those scoring systems are, however, not essential to the operation of the platform; they merely serve as useful guides to those agents who are interested in certain topics (such as “innovation”) or who are looking for opportunities for impact activities.
