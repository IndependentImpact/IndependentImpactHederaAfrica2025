
## Overview of concepts and terminology

The platform’s vocabulary and worldview are thoroughly informed by the Anthropogenic Impact Accounting (AIA) suite of ontologies . The suite consists of four ontologies, namely:

(a)	The Impact Ontology.  This ontology defines the core concepts for understanding “impact” in general. It describes terms such as “event”, “state” and “indicator” and explains how they relate to one another.  

(b)	The Claim Ontology , which lays the foundation for understanding and describing claims, i.e., statements about things, and their substantiation.  

(c)	The Information Communication Ontology , which provides a rudimentary framework for understanding how information (such as a report about an event) is communicated.  

(d)	The Anthropogenic Impact Accounting Ontology  (AIAO), which is the highest-level ontology of the suite. AIAO draws upon and extends concepts from the Impact Ontology, the Claim Ontology and the Information Communication Ontology to provide the framework for describing and understanding how humankind’s activities impact our world.  

The premise of AIAO is: 
“An agent engages in an activity that impacts a state.” 

“Agent” is defined in AIAO as “[a] thing that bears some form of accountability for the occurrence of another thing.”  In other words, an agent is any entity that can be held legally accountable for the impact that they have on others and on their environment. The concept of an agent is not restricted to natural individuals – an agent can, for example, also be a legal entity, such as a company, or a group of individuals working as a team. 
“Activity” is defined as “[a]n event that is orchestrated by an agent,”  whereas “event” is defined in the Impact Ontology as “[a] change in the state of a [thing].”  “Thing” here can be literally anything, but the kinds of things that Independent Impact is particularly interested in are those “things” that can be considered “environments” – natural and social environments alike, e.g., the Nile Delta or the community of Pembroke. Examples of activities include vehicle manufacturing, the transportation of goods or restoring a wetland.

Finally, “state” is defined as “[t]he condition of a thing at a specific point in time, expressed in terms of one or more indicator-value pairs.”  Firstly, the things we are interested in in the context of Independent Impact are, as explained earlier, those things that can be considered “environments”. Secondly, “indicator” here means conventions or standards such as “the mass of a body, measured in kilogramme,” or “the height of a tree, measured in metre.” In the context of Independent Impact we are typically interested in conventions that are used to describe how healthy or unhealthy an environment is. 

Differences in the state of an environment are how we measure and express “impact”. Elaborate.

These concepts and terms form the basis of the Independent Impact paradigm. The rest of this document shall use the terms as they are described above. Readers are encouraged to peruse the AIA suite of ontologies to enhance their understanding of these and related concepts.
Other concepts and terms that deserve introduction already here are:

Bounties – TODO.

Reputation – TODO.

Validation – TODO.

Verification – TODO. 

CR – TODO.

Some final remarks on terminology:

(a)	In this document the term “action” refers to a thing that a user can do on the digital Independent Impact platform, e.g., reviewing some information or publishing an impact claim; the term “activity” should be understood as defined in AIA, i.e., an activity undertaken by an agent in some real-world environment to effect some specific, beneficial impact in that environment (a reforestation activity, for example).  

(b)	In this document the term “activity” also implies “project” and vice versa, unless explicitly stated otherwise. This is purely for conciseness. A project is, as per AIAO, really a collection of activities that are executed to collectively achieve some specific goal.  

(c)	To “own” an activity means to be primarily responsible for the occurrence thereof, and therefore primarily responsible for its impact.  

(d)	All users of the Independent Impact platform are considered agents, even if they never own real-world impact activities. Readers of this document can therefore consider the terms “user(s)” and “agent(s)” as interchangeable, except for where they are explicitly distinguished.
