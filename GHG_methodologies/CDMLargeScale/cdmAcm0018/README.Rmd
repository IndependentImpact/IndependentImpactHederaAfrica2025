# cdmAcm0018

The `cdmAcm0018` package provides helper functions that implement the core
calculations, applicability checks, and simulation utilities for the CDM
large-scale methodology **ACM0018 â€” Electricity generation from biomass in
power-only plants**. The package follows the same tidyverse-oriented structure
as the other methodology packages in this repository.

## Installation

From the repository root you can install the package with:

```r
remotes::install_local("CDMLargeScale/cdmAcm0018")
```

## Example

```{r example}
library(cdmAcm0018)

monitoring <- simulate_acm0018_dataset(2, seed = 123)
aggregate_monitoring_periods_acm0018(monitoring)
```
