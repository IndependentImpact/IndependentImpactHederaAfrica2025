\title{Check ACM0006 biomass feedstock eligibility}
\usage{
check_applicability_biomass_feedstock(feedstock, allowed = c("agricultural residues",
  "forest residues", "wood chips", "energy crops", "biogas", "sewage sludge"))
}
\arguments{
\item{feedstock}{Character string describing the dominant biomass resource (e.g. \code{"agricultural residues"}, \code{"wood chips"}, \code{"energy crops"}).}

\item{allowed}{Vector of admissible feedstock categories. Defaults to the common ACM0006 resources.}
}
\value{
Logical indicating whether the feedstock is acceptable.
}
\description{
Validates that the primary fuel used by the project activity is an eligible biomass resource under ACM0006, which covers dedicated energy crops and a wide range of agricultural and forestry residues.
