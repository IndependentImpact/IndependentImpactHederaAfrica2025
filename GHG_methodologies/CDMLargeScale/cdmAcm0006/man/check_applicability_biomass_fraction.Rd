\title{Check ACM0006 biomass dominance condition}
\usage{
check_applicability_biomass_fraction(biomass_fraction, minimum_fraction = 0.9)
}
\arguments{
\item{biomass_fraction}{Numeric vector giving the biomass contribution to the total fuel mix on an energy basis (between 0 and 1).}

\item{minimum_fraction}{Numeric value specifying the minimum share of biomass required. Defaults to 0.9.}
}
\value{
Logical vector indicating whether the biomass share requirement is satisfied.
}
\description{
Ensures that biomass provides the minimum share of useful energy required by ACM0006 (typically at least 90\% of the thermal input on an energy basis).
}
\examples{
check_applicability_biomass_fraction(0.95)
check_applicability_biomass_fraction(c(0.85, 0.92), minimum_fraction = 0.9)
