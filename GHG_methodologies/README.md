## Repository Structure

- `CDMSmallScale/` — installable packages implementing the approved small-scale
  (AMS) methodologies. Each package retains the existing tidyverse-aligned
  tooling and documentation.
- `CDMLargeScale/` — installable packages for consolidated large-scale (ACM)
  methodologies. The first package in this series is `cdmAcm0002`, covering
  grid-connected renewable electricity generation.
- Every package now stores its long-form methodology walkthrough in
  `vignettes/`, making the repository ready for pkgdown site generation without
  conflicting with the default `docs/` output directory.

## Development Workflow

From the respective package directory (e.g. `CDMSmallScale/cdmAmsIa` or
`CDMLargeScale/cdmAcm0002`) you can rebuild the package,
regenerate documentation, and ensure the vignette renders with the most recent code by running:

```r
devtools::build()
devtools::document()
devtools::build_vignettes()
```

Built vignettes are written to `vignettes/` and can be rendered with `devtools::build_vignettes()`
for inclusion in downstream documentation or reports.

When you need to refresh documentation and vignettes for every package at once, run the
following helper from the repository root. It locates all `CDM*` directories, then walks
into each package directory that starts with `cdmA`, rebuilds the package, regenerates
documentation, rebuilds vignettes, and then returns to the repository root so the next
package can be processed:

```r
group_dirs <- list.files(pattern = "^CDM", full.names = TRUE)
pkg_dirs <- purrr::map(group_dirs, ~list.files(.x, pattern = "^cdmA", full.names = TRUE))
pkg_dirs <- unlist(pkg_dirs, use.names = FALSE)

purrr::map(pkg_dirs, ~{
  setwd(.x)
  devtools::build()
  devtools::document()
  devtools::build_vignettes()
  setwd("~/GHG_methodologies/")
})
```

If you prefer not to rely on **purrr**, replace `purrr::map()` with `lapply()` while keeping the
same side-effect workflow.

To exercise the unit tests for all Large-Scale (ACM) packages in one step, execute the
helper script from the repository root:

```bash
Rscript CDMLargeScale/run_tests.R
```

The script iterates over each `cdmAcm` package and invokes `testthat::test_local()` so the
package code is loaded before the `tests/testthat` suite runs. The command exits with a
non-zero status if any package fails, making it suitable for continuous integration
pipelines.
