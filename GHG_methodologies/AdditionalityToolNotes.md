~Great question. Tool 01 mixes hard math (investment tests) with judgement (alternatives, barriers, common practice). You can standardise the “judgement” without pretending it’s purely computational by making it **explicit, structured, versioned, and attestable**—and then anchoring the whole trail on Hedera.

Below is a practical, engineering-focused blueprint that fits your stack (R + Fluree + HCS) and keeps auditors happy.

# 1) Start from the source of truth (structure Tool 01 explicitly)

Model the tool’s steps and required artefacts as a **canonical schema**:

* **Step 0**: First-of-its-kind check
* **Step 1**: Alternatives identified
* **Step 2**: Investment analysis (IRR/NPV/benchmark, sensitivity)
* **Step 3**: Barriers analysis
* **Step 4**: Common practice analysis
  (These are the exact steps and scope of AM-Tool-01 v7.0.0.) ([CDM UNFCCC][1])

Represent each step in Fluree as first-class collections (JSON-LD preferred), with fields for:

* **Inputs** (data, sources, dates, benchmarks);
* **Method** (which rule set or decision table was used);
* **Computation** (pure calculations);
* **Judgement** (assessor rationale + references);
* **Outcome** (pass/fail/qualitative rating);
* **Reviewer attestations** (who signed off, when, on what version).

Why Fluree: it gives you **immutable, temporal, graph** storage with **data-centric rules (“smart functions”)** to enforce shape and policy at write time and to preserve provenance. ([GitHub][2])

# 2) Separate *calculation* from *interpretation* (two engines)

* **Calc engine (R package):** deterministic functions for Tool 01 numerics (e.g., Step 2 investment analysis). Freeze dependencies with `renv.lock`, expose inputs/outputs as JSON.
* **Decision engine:** encode the judgement logic in **decision tables** (DMN is ideal, or your own YAML/JSON). Keep these tables human-readable and versioned. The schema should record which **policy pack** (see next section) and DMN version was applied to each case.

This split makes it obvious what’s math vs. what’s judgement, and lets you regression-test the math while debating the decision tables separately.

# 3) Make interpretation reproducible via “Policy Packs”

A **Policy Pack** is a versioned bundle that captures *how you interpret Tool 01*, including:

* Decision tables for Steps 0, 1, 3, 4 (e.g., thresholds for market penetration in common-practice; what counts as a credible alternative; evidence standards for barriers).
* Citations to sources used by the policy (sector studies, regulations).
* **Change log** explaining *why* interpretations changed (map each change back to Tool 01 clauses).
* Unit tests (golden cases) and expected outcomes.

Store the pack in Fluree (content-addressed hash) and the **hash on HCS** (see §6). Anyone can later verify *which policy pack* produced a result.

# 4) Evidence-first workflow (transparent by default)

For each judgement field, require:

* **Evidence items** (PDFs, datasets, URLs) with metadata: publisher, date accessed, jurisdiction;
* **Quoted excerpt / table** used, plus a short **rationale** (“how this evidence supports the conclusion”);
* **Reviewer checklist** (binary checks + free text) and **sign-off**.

Enforce this with Fluree smart-function rules (e.g., no “Step 4 outcome” unless ≥1 evidence item with valid source metadata exists; no “finalise” unless ≥2 reviewers attest). Fluree rules/smart functions are made for exactly this kind of **policy at the data layer**. ([Fluree Developers][3])

# 5) Standardised data model (sketch)

**AssessmentCase**

* `project_id`, `methodology_ref` (e.g., “AM-Tool-01 v7.0.0”), `policy_pack_id`, `created_at`
* `steps`: array of **Step** objects

**Step**

* `step_id` (0..4), `inputs` (JSON), `calc_outputs` (JSON), `decision_table_version`,
* `judgement`: `{ rationale, references:[evidence_id…], outcome, uncertainty:[…] }`
* `attestations`: `[{ reviewer_did, role, statement_hash, signed_at }]`

**Evidence**

* `hash`, `uri`, `publisher`, `title`, `date_published`, `date_accessed`, `jurisdiction`, `excerpt`, `file_type`

Use **JCS canonical JSON** (or another canonicalizer) then hash each stored object to get a stable digest to anchor to HCS.

# 6) Hedera Consensus Service: your public audit trail

For transparency, **anchor every meaningful state transition** to Hedera HCS:

* Create one topic per program (or per project), and **submit messages** like:
  `AssessmentCreated`, `InputFrozen`, `CalcRun`, `DecisionApplied`, `EvidenceAdded`, `AttestationAdded`, `Finalised`, each carrying:

  * `assessment_id`
  * `object_type` + `object_hash` (JCS SHA-256)
  * `policy_pack_hash`
  * optional minimal metadata (no PII)

Any third party can later **query a mirror node** and verify the timeline and hashes match the Fluree objects. Hedera’s mirror nodes expose HCS messages for verification and replay. ([Hedera Documentation][4])

Minimal HCS message (JSON, canonicalised before hashing):

```json
{
  "event":"DecisionApplied",
  "assessment_id":"A-2025-00123",
  "object_type":"Step4",
  "object_hash":"sha256:…",
  "policy_pack_hash":"sha256:…",
  "who":"did:key:z6Mkh…",
  "why_ref":"evidence:E-8872",
  "ts":"2025-10-12T11:42:00Z"
}
```

# 7) R package: make runs fully reproducible

* Pure functions; no hidden state.
* Export a `run_assessment()` that takes **frozen inputs** (JSON) and returns **calc_outputs** + a signed **run manifest** (package version, Git commit, `renv.lock` hash, OS, seeds).
* Ship **golden test vectors** for common project archetypes.
* Emit a **machine-readable assessment bundle** (ZIP): `inputs.json`, `calc_outputs.json`, `judgement.json`, `evidence_index.json`, `manifest.json`, plus a `report.html`. Hash the bundle and anchor to HCS.

# 8) Review governance: roles & attestations

* **Maker–checker** separation: author vs. independent reviewer.
* Multi-sig closing: require (say) two reviewers to attest before `Finalised`.
* **Amendment protocol**: any post-final change creates a new version with diff + reason; both versions’ hashes posted to HCS.

Use Fluree roles/rules to enforce who can transition which states; these checks run at the **data layer**. ([GitHub][5])

# 9) Output that’s both human- and machine-verifiable

Produce two artefacts per case:

1. **Human report** (PDF/HTML): step-by-step with evidence callouts, decision tables applied, and an **HCS proof section** (topic id, message seq nos).
2. **Machine bundle** (above) + a **verification script** that:

   * Recomputes hashes from bundle;
   * Queries the HCS mirror node for the topic and event window;
   * Confirms all `object_hash` / `policy_pack_hash` and ordering.
     (Hedera’s tutorials show how to submit and query messages via mirror nodes.) ([Hedera Documentation][6])

# 10) Interoperability & “what standard are you following?”

* You’re implementing CDM Tool 01. Keep the **verbatim mapping** from your schema/policy pack to the tool’s clauses and steps, so reviewers can trace each conclusion to a clause. ([CDM UNFCCC][1])
* Be aware: in the VCS ecosystem, Verra published updated additionality tools (VT0008/VT0009) that **replace CDM Tool 01/02** for many projects; your architecture remains valid, but the **policy pack** would swap in the VCS logic. ([Verra][7])

# 11) Minimal event taxonomy (ready to implement)

* `PolicyPackPublished` (hash, semver, changelog)
* `AssessmentCreated` (id, policy_pack_hash)
* `InputFrozen` (inputs_hash)
* `CalcRun` (calc_outputs_hash, r_manifest_hash)
* `EvidenceAdded` (evidence_hash)
* `DecisionApplied` (step_id, judgement_hash)
* `AttestationAdded` (statement_hash, reviewer_did)
* `Finalised` (bundle_hash)

These are tiny, privacy-light messages whose **payloads are verifiable** against Fluree.

# 12) Security & privacy

* Use DIDs (or plain public keys) for signers; **sign attestation statements** that reference the object and its hash (detached signatures).
* Put sensitive docs in your secure store; only the **hashes** and minimal metadata go to HCS.
* Fluree’s **policy-based security** and validation (e.g., SHACL) can enforce schemas and roles centrally. ([GitHub][2])

## Implementation checklist (short)

1. **Schemas:** JSON-LD for AssessmentCase/Step/Evidence/Attestation in Fluree.
2. **Policy packs:** DMN/YAML + tests; publish hash to HCS.
3. **R package:** pure calcs + manifests; emit bundle and hashes.
4. **Fluree rules:** block state transitions unless evidence/attestations exist. ([Fluree Developers][3])
5. **HCS integration:** post event hashes; expose mirror-node verification script. ([Hedera Documentation][4])
6. **Reports:** human PDF + machine bundle; include HCS proof section.

If you’d like, I can sketch the JSON-LD schema, a sample DMN table for common-practice thresholds, and an R skeleton (`run_assessment()`, manifest, and HCS submitter).
