\title{Implementation of CDM Small-Scale Methodology AMS-III.E}
\description{
Tools for estimating emission reductions from biomass treatment projects under
AMS-III.E. The package provides equation helpers, applicability diagnostics,
simulation utilities, and workflow wrappers to calculate baseline emissions,
project emissions, leakage, and net reductions for combustion, gasification, and
mechanical-thermal systems handling decaying biomass.
