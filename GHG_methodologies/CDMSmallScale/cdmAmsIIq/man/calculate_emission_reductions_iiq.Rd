\title{Calculate emission reductions (Equation 4)}
\description{Translate Equation (4) of AMS-II.Q by subtracting project and leakage emissions from baseline emissions.}
\usage{calculate_emission_reductions_iiq(
  baseline_emissions,
  project_emissions,
  leakage_emissions = NULL,
  group_cols = NULL,
  output_col = "emission_reductions_tco2e"
)}
\arguments{
  \item{baseline_emissions}{Tibble containing baseline emissions in tCO2e.}
  \item{project_emissions}{Tibble containing project emissions in tCO2e.}
  \item{leakage_emissions}{Optional tibble containing leakage emissions in tCO2e; when omitted leakage is assumed to be zero.}
  \item{group_cols}{Optional character vector of grouping columns shared across inputs.}
  \item{output_col}{Name of the emission reduction column returned.}
}
\value{A tibble with emission reductions aggregated by the requested grouping.}

baseline <- tibble::tibble(building_id = "A", baseline_emissions_tco2e = 12)
