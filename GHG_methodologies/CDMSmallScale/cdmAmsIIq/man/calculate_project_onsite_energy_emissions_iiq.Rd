\title{Calculate onsite energy supply emissions (Equation 3)}
\description{Translate Equation (3) of AMS-II.Q by converting onsite energy use into emissions. Returns zero when onsite energy is absent.}
\usage{calculate_project_onsite_energy_emissions_iiq(
  project_data,
  onsite_energy_col = "project_onsite_energy_gj",
  emission_factor_col = "project_onsite_emission_factor_tco2_per_gj",
  group_cols = NULL,
  output_col = "project_onsite_emissions_tco2e"
)}
\arguments{
  \item{project_data}{A tibble describing project monitoring observations.}
  \item{onsite_energy_col}{Column storing onsite energy use (set to \code{NULL} when absent).}
  \item{emission_factor_col}{Column storing onsite energy emission factors (tCO2e per unit of energy).}
  \item{group_cols}{Optional character vector of grouping columns shared with other datasets.}
  \item{output_col}{Name of the onsite emissions column returned in the tibble.}
}
\value{A tibble containing onsite emissions aggregated by the requested grouping.}
