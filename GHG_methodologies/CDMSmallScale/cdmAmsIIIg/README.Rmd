`cdmAmsIIIg` implements the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) small-scale methodology **AMS-III.G Landfill methane recovery**. The package follows tidyverse design principles and exposes equation-level helpers, applicability diagnostics, and workflow orchestration utilities to reproduce emission reduction estimates for landfill gas recovery projects.

## Installation

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("independent-impact/GHG_methodologies/cdmAmsIIIg")
```

## Getting Started

```r
library(cdmAmsIIIg)
library(dplyr)

simulated <- simulate_ams_iiig_dataset(n_sites = 2, n_periods = 3, seed = 2025)

applicability <- check_applicability_landfill_characteristics_iiig(simulated$applicability, group_cols = "site_id") %>%
  left_join(
    check_applicability_gas_management_iiig(simulated$applicability, group_cols = "site_id"),
    by = "site_id"
  ) %>%
  left_join(
    check_applicability_monitoring_framework_iiig(simulated$applicability, group_cols = "site_id"),
    by = "site_id"
  )

reductions <- estimate_emission_reductions_ams_iiig(
  baseline_data = simulated$baseline,
  project_data = simulated$project,
  leakage_data = simulated$leakage,
  group_cols = "site_id",
  baseline_args = list(days_col = "days_in_period"),
  project_args = list(days_col = "days_in_period")
)

applicability
reductions
```

For a more detailed walk-through see the vignette in `vignettes/cdmAmsIIIg-methodology.Rmd`.

## Applicability Conditions

Projects must satisfy core AMS-III.G requirements before emission reductions can be claimed. Use the package helpers to document each criterion:

- `check_applicability_landfill_characteristics_iiig()` – verifies landfill management status, biodegradable waste fraction, and readiness for gas well installation.
- `check_applicability_gas_management_iiig()` – confirms compliant destruction/utilisation technologies, minimum operating hours, and redundancy.
- `check_applicability_monitoring_framework_iiig()` – ensures monitoring plans include sufficient flow, methane fraction, and calibration measurements.

## Key Equations

`cdmAmsIIIg` translates the numbered equations from AMS-III.G into composable R functions:

| Equation | Function | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| (1) | `calculate_baseline_methane_emissions_iiig()` | Estimates baseline methane emissions released without gas recovery. |
| (2) | `calculate_project_emissions_iiig()` | Converts project methane capture, destruction, and energy inputs into project emissions. |
| (3) | `calculate_leakage_emissions_iiig()` | Aggregates transport, residual waste treatment, and displacement impacts. |
| (4) | `calculate_emission_reductions_iiig()` | Computes net emission reductions after project and leakage adjustments. |

The meta-wrapper `estimate_emission_reductions_ams_iiig()` chains these helpers together for tidyverse-friendly datasets.

## Monitoring and Simulation Utilities

- `aggregate_monitoring_periods_iiig()` summarises measured data across reporting periods while preserving entity identifiers.
- `simulate_ams_iiig_dataset()` generates example datasets with monitoring metadata to support tests, demos, and onboarding.
