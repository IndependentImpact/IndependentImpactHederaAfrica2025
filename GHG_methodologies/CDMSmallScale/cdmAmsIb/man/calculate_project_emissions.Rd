\title{Calculate project emissions (Equation 3)}
\usage{
calculate_project_emissions(
  project_energy,
  energy_col = "project_energy_mj",
  project_emission_factor = 0,
  output_col = "project_emissions_tco2e"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{project_energy}{A tibble with project energy values in MJ.}

\item{energy_col}{Name of the column containing project energy in MJ.}

\item{project_emission_factor}{Project emission factor in tCO2e/MJ (default 0).}

\item{output_col}{Name of the resulting project emissions column.}
}
\value{
A tibble with project emissions in tCO2e.
}
\description{
Computes project emissions for AMS-I.B where auxiliary fossil fuel use may be present (e.g. back-up diesel engines). The default assumes zero emissions when renewable energy fully drives the mechanical system.
}
\examples{
project_energy <- tibble::tibble(project_energy_mj = c(1000, 1200))
calculate_project_emissions(project_energy, energy_col = "project_energy_mj", project_emission_factor = 0)
