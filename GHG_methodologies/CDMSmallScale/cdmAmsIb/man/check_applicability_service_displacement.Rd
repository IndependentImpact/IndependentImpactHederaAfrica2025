\title{Check AMS-I.B service displacement condition}
\usage{
check_applicability_service_displacement(fossil_service_share, minimum_fraction = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{fossil_service_share}{Share of the baseline mechanical service provided by fossil fuels (0-1).}

\item{minimum_fraction}{Minimum share that must be displaced (default 0.5).}
}
\value{
Logical indicating whether the displacement criterion is satisfied.
}
\description{
Confirms that the renewable mechanical system replaces baseline fossil-fuel equipment by assessing the share of service output previously delivered by fossil energy.

\examples{
check_applicability_service_displacement(fossil_service_share = 0.8)
check_applicability_service_displacement(fossil_service_share = 0.3)
