\title{Check AMS-I.B installed capacity threshold}
\usage{
check_applicability_mechanical_capacity(capacity_kw, threshold_kw = 15000)
}
\arguments{
\item{capacity_kw}{Rated mechanical capacity in kilowatts (kW).}

\item{threshold_kw}{Threshold in kW, defaulting to 15000 (15 MW).}
}
\value{
Logical indicating whether the capacity condition is satisfied.
}
\description{
Validates the AMS-I.B applicability condition that renewable mechanical systems must remain within the 15 MW small-scale threshold.
}
\examples{
check_applicability_mechanical_capacity(capacity_kw = 750)
check_applicability_mechanical_capacity(capacity_kw = 20000)
