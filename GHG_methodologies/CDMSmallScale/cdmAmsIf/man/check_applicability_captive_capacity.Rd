\title{Check AMS-I.F captive system capacity threshold}
\usage{check_applicability_captive_capacity(capacity_kw, threshold_kw = 15000)}
\arguments{
  \item{capacity_kw}{Rated electrical capacity in kilowatts (kW).}
  \item{threshold_kw}{Threshold in kW, defaulting to 15000 (15 MW).}
}
\value{Logical indicating whether the capacity condition is satisfied.}
\description{Validates the AMS-I.F applicability condition that renewable electricity systems supplying
captive and mini-grid consumers remain within the small-scale limit for Type I CDM projects.}
