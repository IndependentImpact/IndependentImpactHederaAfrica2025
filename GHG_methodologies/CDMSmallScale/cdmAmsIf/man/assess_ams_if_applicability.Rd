  \item{capacity_threshold_kw}{Capacity threshold in kilowatts.}
  \item{renewable_minimum_fraction}{Minimum renewable penetration required for eligibility.}
  \item{captive_minimum_fraction}{Minimum captive use share required for eligibility.}
}
\value{A tibble summarising each applicability condition and whether it passes.}
\description{Evaluates the key quantitative applicability criteria for AMS-I.F and returns a tidy summary of results.}
