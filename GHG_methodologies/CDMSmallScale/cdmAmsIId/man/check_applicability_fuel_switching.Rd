\usage{
check_applicability_fuel_switching(
  baseline_data,
  project_data,
  fuel_col = "baseline_fuel_quantity",
  emission_factor_col = "baseline_emission_factor_tco2_per_gj",
  project_fuel_col = "project_fuel_quantity",
  project_emission_factor_col = "project_emission_factor_tco2_per_gj"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{baseline_data}{Tibble containing baseline fuel quantities and emission factors.}

\item{project_data}{Tibble containing project fuel quantities and emission factors.}

\item{fuel_col}{Baseline column storing fuel quantities.}

\item{emission_factor_col}{Baseline column storing emission factors (tCO2e per unit energy).}

\item{project_fuel_col}{Project column storing fuel quantities.}

\item{project_emission_factor_col}{Project column storing emission factors.}
}
\value{
Logical scalar indicating whether project emission factors are lower.
}
\description{
Projects that switch to lower-carbon fuels must document that the project fuel mix has a lower emission factor than the baseline mix.
}
