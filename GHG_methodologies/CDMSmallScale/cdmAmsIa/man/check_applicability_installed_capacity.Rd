\title{Check AMS-I.A installed capacity threshold}
\usage{
check_applicability_installed_capacity(
  capacity_kw,
  renewable_fraction,
  threshold_kw = 15000
)
}
\arguments{
\item{capacity_kw}{Total installed capacity in kilowatts (kW).}

\item{renewable_fraction}{Share of electricity generated from renewable sources (0-1).}

\item{threshold_kw}{Threshold in kW, defaulting to 15000 (15 MW).}
}
\value{
Logical indicating whether the condition is satisfied.
}
\description{
Evaluates the AMS-I.A applicability condition that total installed renewable capacity must
remain within the small-scale threshold of 15 MW.
