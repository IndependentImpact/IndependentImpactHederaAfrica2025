\title{Check AMS-I.A distributed generation condition}
\usage{
check_applicability_distributed_generation(
  fossil_fraction_baseline,
  minimum_fraction = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fossil_fraction_baseline}{Share of baseline electricity provided by fossil fuels (0-1).}

\item{minimum_fraction}{Minimum fossil share that must be displaced to qualify (default 0.5).}
}
\value{
Logical indicating whether the generation primarily displaces fossil fuel use.
}
\description{
Ensures the electricity generation unit is located at or near the user site and primarily
displaces captive fossil fuel generation, approximated by the share of pre-project fossil use.
}
\examples{
check_applicability_distributed_generation(fossil_fraction_baseline = 0.9)
check_applicability_distributed_generation(fossil_fraction_baseline = 0.3)
