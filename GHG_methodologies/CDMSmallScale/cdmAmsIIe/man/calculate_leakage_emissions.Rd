\title{Calculate leakage emissions for AMS-II.E (Equation 3)}
\usage{
calculate_leakage_emissions(
  leakage_data,
  leakage_col = "leakage_emissions_tco2e",
  group_cols = NULL,
  output_col = "leakage_emissions_tco2e"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{leakage_data}{A tibble containing leakage components expressed in tCO2e.}

\item{leakage_col}{Column storing leakage emission quantities.}

\item{group_cols}{Optional character vector of grouping variables to retain.}

\item{output_col}{Name of the resulting column storing leakage totals.}
}
\value{
A tibble with leakage totals.
}
\description{
Equation (3) of AMS-II.E accounts for leakage linked to upstream fuel supply, equipment disposal, or other market effects.
}
\examples{
leakage <- tibble::tibble(building_id = c("Office_A", "Office_B"),
                          leakage_emissions_tco2e = c(2.1, 1.5))
calculate_leakage_emissions(leakage, group_cols = "building_id")
}
